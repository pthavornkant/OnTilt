Option Menu added in Level selection
multiplier for tilting( does not affect on pc)
 
normal Level selection
well..it works... it can do gimmick side in an hr

Game can start by touching anywhere on mainmenu

there are many balls in the ball pack if you want to try it out
(need rigidbody and sphere collider attach)

the menu part is not too hard to do. just work on level design for now. 
textures are mostly in the prototype folder. 

I will do the screen shots later after all the stages are done.
