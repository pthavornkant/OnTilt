# OnTilt
Spring 2014 Mobile App Challenge Entry with Tianen Yu.

OnTilt is a mobile game that re-imagines the classic marble-maze tilting game.

A variety of levels are designed to challenge players to tilt their way to the (G)oal, while avoiding
pitfalls along the way. Gimmick Stages add in challenges like collecting chips in order to activate the goal, 
as well as destructible blocks and zip pads that alter gameplay.

The game utilizes your smart phone's accelerometer in order to read tilting motions. You can even adjust the sensitivity 
of this function in game, and menus are handled by using your phone's touch screen. 

Developed in Unity using Javascript.

The APK file is included.

Game music by Andrew Tae.
